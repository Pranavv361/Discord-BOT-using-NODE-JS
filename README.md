    - Navigate to the "Bot" section on the left sidebar.
    - Click "Add Bot" and confirm by clicking "Yes, do it!".

4. **Get Client ID and Token:**

    - In the "General Information" section, youâ€™ll find the Client ID.

    - Select "bot" under "SCOPES" and then select the necessary permissions under "BOT PERMISSIONS".

## Configuring the Bot

1. **Intents:**

    Intents are a way for Discord to send you events you are interested in. They help reduce the amount of data sent to you and improve security.

    For more details, check the [Discord Gateway Intents Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#list-of-intents).

    In your bot, we use the following intents:

    ```javascript
    const client = new Client({
      intents: [
        GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
        GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
        GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent,
      ],
    });
    ```

2. **Why Intents are Required:**

    Intents help specify which events the bot will receive from Discord, ensuring it only gets relevant data. This helps in optimizing performance and security.

## Running the Bot

1. **Start the bot:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. **Interact with the bot:**

    - Use `create <url>` command in Discord to generate a short URL.
    - Visit `http://localhost:8000/<shortId>` to be redirected to the original URL.
